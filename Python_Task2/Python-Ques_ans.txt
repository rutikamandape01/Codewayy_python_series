1) Why is list used?
=> Lists are one of the four built-in data structures in Python, 
   together with tuples, dictionaries, and sets. They are used to 
   store an ordered collection of items, which might be of different types.

2)How do lists and sets differ?
=> a) Lists and tuples are standard Python data types that store values 
      in a sequence. Sets are another standard Python data type that also 
      store values. 
   b) The major difference is that sets, unlike lists or tuples, 
    cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element and store unordered values.

3) Application of dictionaries with a real world example.
=> Dictionaries can be used for :-Data storage - so instead of remembering that
   a person’s name is at list index 0, and the address is at list index 1 - we can 
   create a dictionary with keys of ‘name’ and ‘address’ - bingo - your code is more readable.
